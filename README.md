# Chat Bot

Created a simple but accurate chatbot using Python and a JSON file to store all the responses. It takes the input from user and finds the most appropriate response by keeping a track of scores. The response with the highest score is then displayed on screen. This provides the user with accurate responses. If it doesn't understand something it will reply with a bunch of random responses telling you it doesn't know how to reply to it. It is a well trained simple robot for your general questions and not an AI robot.
